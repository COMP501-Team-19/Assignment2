<h1>Risks of online health websites</h1>

<ul><li><b><u>Spread of misinformation by “leading” sources: </b></u><br>
  Amongst the thousands of health related websites available, the most prominent provider is WebMD. They are “the leading source for trustworthy and timely health and medical news and information” (WebMD, 2005). Even though they have an extensive health database and easy user accessibility, online health providers face controversies in regards to the quality and credibility of the medical diagnosis provided. There is a great variance in the information from website to website and none of the information is regulated. 
</li>  <p></p>
  <li><b><u>Cyberchondria:</b></u><br>
    Cyberchondria is the irrational anxiety with perceived health concerns, often driven by self-diagnosis and online research. A research conducted by (Varma et al. 2021) stated that the prevalence of cyberchondria amidst the COVID-19 pandemic was at an all time high. As people were cooped up in their home, they became almost dependent on the internet as their only source of comfort through the world-wide health panic - Potentially causing further unnecessary panic and anxiety. 
  </li>  <p></p>
  <li><b><u>Double-edged sword: <br></b></u>
    Although some of the information available online may benefit a group of people, it may just as well bring harm to another. Virtual communities dedicated to non-suicidal and self-injury were praised for providing support, but people were cautioned that participation could trigger urges to cause harm (Baecker, 2019). There are large amounts of dangerous information available, ranging from self-harm assisting, pro-disordered behaviour groups, drug and alcohol abuse threads and others.
