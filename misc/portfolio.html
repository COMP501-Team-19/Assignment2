	<h3>Draft proposal</h3> 
	<b>Describing the topic: </b><br>
	There has been a surge of medical information available online in the field of healthcare and medicine. Online health information is a valuable service which is rising as an alternative to traditional face-to-face medical care. 
	
	<p></p>Amongst the thousands of health related websites available, the most prominent provider is WebMD. They are “the leading source for trustworthy and timely health and medical news and information” (WebMD, 2005). Even though they have an extensive health database and easy user accessibility, online health providers face controversies in regards to the quality and credibility of the medical diagnosis provided. 
	
	<p></p><b>Focus of our research: </b><br>
	We will be focusing on the information available on online health providers, such as WebMD, Mayo Clinic, SNS health communities, and the integrity of the information. 
	
	<p></p><b>Why did we choose this topic:</b><br>
	As students living in a post-pandemic society, we can easily observe concerns people have over their health and how they seek advice and comfort through online health providers. We hope to research the credibility of the information available to the public and how detrimental the effects of misinformation can be on one’s well being. 
	
	
	<h3>Computers and Society: Modern Perspectives (Textbook Notes) </h3>
	<h4>4.2 Online health information and online communities of care</h4>
	
	
	<p></p>“There is never enough time for physicians to practise medicine as they would like, Nor can they answer all the questions a patient asks.” 
	-> Demand for medical services, quality of service
	
	<p></p>“Patients cannot always articulate questions that are in the back of their minds while they are in the doctor’s office” 
	-> Medical needs not met/ attended to 
	
	<p></p>Accessing information and knowledge about health conditions was always difficult. 
	-> Patients only had access to mostly “incomprehensible material that was not necessarily current or understandable for laymen” 
	
	<p></p>By 2001, there were 70,00 websites with online health information being used by over 50 million people. 
	
	<p></p>By 2003, an estimated 4.5 percent of all web searches were ‘health-related’ (amounting to 6.75 million searches each day). 
	
	<p></p>By 2011, 80 percent of US internet users had looked online for health information.
	
	<p></p>Proactive research often resulted in lengthier discussion between patient and physician. 
	-> Sometimes led to diminished patient trust in the physician 
	
	<p></p>Online medical information is a valuable service 
	-> Unless its use is impeded by information overload, site disorganisation, searching challenges, incomprehensible language, user unfriendliness and impermanence.
	-> Vital that online medical information is credible, believable, authoritative and trustworthy. 
	
	<p></p>Establish credbility  through peer review, rating systems and codes of conduct. 
	-> May not be 100% effective, a study found university students had a tendency to rate all internet health information as relatively credible - Even when it originated from a source that was not authoritative. 
	-> Another study found participants never check the ‘about us’ sections of websites, or the disclaimers or disclosures. 
	
	<p></p>Credibility of the information available to patients is questionable
	
	<p></p>“There is also evidence that health information seekers are usually looking for a specific condition that fits a diagnosis received by themselves or a friend” 
	-> Attention/sympathy seeking behaviours?
	
	<p></p>One study reported that 62.4 percent of patients fully trusted their physicians
	-> Roughly one-fourth expressed a lot of trust in the internet-sourced data. 
	-> Trust shifting from human provider to machine. Potential future redundancy of doctors? Personalised AI healthcare systems? 
	
	<p></p>10.9 percent of people actually go to their physician first when feeling sick 
	-> 48.7 percent went online to research prior to visiting 
	
	<p></p>Fake news
	-> 20th Century Fox created a fake health website and released fake articles about topics such as abortion and vaccines to promote a film ‘A cure for Wellness” 
	
	<p></p>Experts emphasise the importance of consulting with a physician in addition to using internet research. 
	
	<p></p>Social media 
	-> People reach out online to others who share the same condition or interest. 
	-> In 2014 Pew Research data showed that 26 percent of adult internet users had in 2013 read or watched someone’s online report about a health or medical concern; 16 percent had sought out others who shared the same concerns. 
	
	<p></p>Crowdsourcing a problem or task (Broadcast a request for help on the internet for information or skills) 
	 
	<p></p>“More knowledge, better coping, and greater social support among patients”
	
	
	<p></p>Double edged sword: 
	Easily accessible information that can benefit one person can just as easily trigger someone else. 
	
	<p></p>A discussion of virtual communities dedicated to non-suicidal self-injury praised such groups for providing support, typically to youth, but cautioned that participation could also trigger urges to harm oneself. 
	-> Internet was once used to arrange two suicide pacts involving nine individuals in Japan
	-> Large amount of suicide-assisting information easily available on the internet. 
	
	<p></p>Tons of information on Reddit about getting high on drugs as well as fighting an addiction to opioids.
	-> “Share your experience” types of websites

	<b>Slide 1: </b><br>
	
	Computers in healthcare and medicine: Health Websites 
	
	<p></p>Why do we reach for online healthcare? 
	Modern humans crave convenience. Being able to ease one’s mind of a health concern in the convenience of their own home is a lifestyle luxury made possible through technological advancement.  Only 10.9% of people visit their physician as their first point of contact. 48.7% of people preferred to conduct online research before seeking any physical advice (Baecker, 2019). 
	
	<p></p>Increase in demand for accessible healthcare: 
	
	<p></p>By 2001, there were 70,000 websites with online health information being used by over 50 million people. 
	By 2003, an estimated 4.5 percent of all web searches were ‘health-related’ (amounting to 6.75 million searches each day). 
	By 2011, 80 percent of US internet users had looked online for health information. (Baecker, 2019) 
	
	<p></p>Building connections and relationships: 
	The development of the internet and social media has allowed for individuals to reach out online and connect with others who share similar medical conditions or interests. In 2014, data from the Pew Research Center displayed that 26% of adult internet users in 2013 had read or watched someone’s online report about a health or medical concern. 16% of internet users had sought out to connect with others who shared similar health concerns.
	
	
	<p></p><br><b>Slide 2: </b><br>
	
	<p></p>Spread of misinformation by “leading” sources: 
	Amongst the thousands of health related websites available, the most prominent provider is WebMD. They are “the leading source for trustworthy and timely health and medical news and information” (WebMD, 2005). Even though they have an extensive health database and easy user accessibility, online health providers face controversies in regards to the quality and credibility of the medical diagnosis provided. There is a great variance in the information from website to website and none of the information is regulated. 
	
	<p></p>Cyberchondria:
	Cyberchondria is the irrational anxiety with perceived health concerns, often driven by self-diagnosis and online research. A research conducted by (Varma et al. 2021) stated that the prevalence of cyberchondria amidst the COVID-19 pandemic was at an all time high. As people were cooped up in their home, they became almost dependent on the internet as their only source of comfort through the world-wide health panic - Potentially causing further unnecessary panic and anxiety. 
	
	<p></p>Double-edged sword: 
	Although some of the information available online may benefit a group of people, it may just as well bring harm to another. Virtual communities dedicated to non-suicidal and self-injury were praised for providing support, but people were cautioned that participation could trigger urges to cause harm (Baecker, 2019). There are large amounts of dangerous information available, ranging from self-harm assisting, pro-disordered behaviour groups, drug and alcohol abuse threads and others. 
	
	
	<p></p><br><b>Slide 3: </b><br>
	
	<p></p>Future of healthcare? 
	One study reported that only 62.4% of patients fully trusted their physicians and roughly one-fourth expressed trust in data sourced from the internet (Baecker, 2019). The trust individuals have towards their healthcare is slowly shifting from human providers to machines and online based information. This could indicate a potential future redundancy of human doctors. There is always a possibility that in the future artificial intelligence could be so advanced that every individual has access to personalised AI healthcare systems right in their hands. 
	
	<p></p>Online health providers are in demand and valuable tools that contribute to the well-being of many individuals around the world. However, it would be crucial to check for the validity and credibility of the information and utilise it in moderation. It is also advisable to keep in mind the importance of consulting with a physician in addition to using internet research.
