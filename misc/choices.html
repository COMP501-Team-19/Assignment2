<h1>What choices do we have?</h1>

<p>There is a plethora of online health websites available on the internet for anyone to access. It is crucial to remember, though, that the information's accuracy and quality can differ significantly across websites. It's crucial to use reputable sources for health-related information. Some of the most well-known and trustworthy websites for health information include: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="cdc.gov">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a></li>
<li><a href="webmd.com">WebMD</a></li>
<li><a href="mayoclinic.org">MayoClinic</a></li>
<li><a href="nih.gov">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the vast amount of health related information available online, every individual can pick and choose where to get information from. In addition, as more and more people are spending more time online, social media has also become a source of health related information for some. This opens up the possibility for misinformation, disinformation and "Fake News" to spread, especially amongst vulnerable individuals. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Twitter and Facebook were used to disseminate misinformation either intentionally or inadvertently. (Ferreira C, et al. 2022)</p>

<p>The spread of misinformation on social media and online health websites during the COVID-19 pandemic has helped us identify how the effects of misinformation exposure can differ by the individual's ehealth literacy level. Therefore, in order to reduce the spread of wrong and potentially harmful health information online, there is a great need for health literacy education at the societal level. (Kim & Tandoc, 2022)</p>
