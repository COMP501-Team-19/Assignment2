<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>


</ul><p><b><u>Why do we reach for online healthcare?</u> </b><br>
  Modern humans crave convenience. Being able to ease one’s mind of a health concern in the convenience of their own home is a lifestyle luxury made possible through technological advancement.  Only 10.9% of people visit their physician as their first point of contact. 48.7% of people preferred to conduct online research before seeking any physical advice (Baecker, 2019). 
  <br>
  <br><b><u>Increase in demand for accessible healthcare:</u> </b><br>
  
  By 2001, there were 70,000 websites with online health information being used by over 50 million people. 
  By 2003, an estimated 4.5 percent of all web searches were ‘health-related’ (amounting to 6.75 million searches each day). 
  By 2011, 80 percent of US internet users had looked online for health information.
  (Baecker, 2019) 
  <br>
  <br><b><u>Building connections and relationships:</u> </b><br>
  The development of the internet and social media has allowed for individuals to reach out online and connect with others who share similar medical conditions or interests. In 2014, data from the Pew Research Center displayed that 26% of adult internet users in 2013 had read or watched someone’s online report about a health or medical concern. 16% of internet users had sought out to connect with others who shared similar health concerns.
