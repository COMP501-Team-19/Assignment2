<h1>Chosen Technology/Topic</h1>

<p><em><br><b>Topic Description:</b><br>
  <p>There has been a surge of medical information available online in the field of healthcare and medicine. Online health information is a valuable service which is rising as an alternative to traditional face-to-face medical care. </p>

  <p>Amongst the thousands of health related websites available, the most prominent provider is WebMD. They are “the leading source for trustworthy and timely health and medical news and information” (WebMD, 2005). Even though they have an extensive health database and easy user accessibility, online health providers face controversies in regards to the quality and credibility of the medical diagnosis provided. </p>
  
  <br><b>Focus of our research: </b><br>
  <p>We will be focusing on the information available on online health providers, such as WebMD, Mayo Clinic, SNS health communities, and the integrity of the information. </p>
  
  <br><b>Why did we choose this topic:</b><br>
  <p>As students living in a post-pandemic society, we can easily observe concerns people have over their health and how they seek advice and comfort through online health providers. We hope to research the credibility of the information available to the public and how detrimental the effects of misinformation can be on one’s well being.</p>
